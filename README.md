# XMLWinFormsSample
XML Validation against XSD , Create, Open, Edit , Save XML File

The idea is a project having a mandatory name and type and an optional list of values Loaded, Created, Edited and Saved to an XML File and Validated Against XSD Schema.
 
You have to create an application allowing you to do:
•	Load existing project over the menu “File
•	Create a new project over the menu “File”
o	user should be able to
	select the location and name of the project file
	edit name
	edit project type
	add / edit / delete elements in value list
•	edit project (in main view or dialog, it doesn’t matter)
o	Edit name
o	edit project type
o	add / edit / delete elements in value list
	Note that buttons “edit” and “delete” are allowed only in case any value is selected. Multiple selections of values are not allowed.
•	Save the project over the menu “File” (if data is schema compliant)
•	Close application (over menu file).
