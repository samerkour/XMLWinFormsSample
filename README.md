# XMLWinFormsSample
XML Validation against XSD , Create, Open, Edit , Save XML File

The idea is a project that have a mandatory name and type and an optional list of values Loaded, Created, Edited and Saved to an XML File and Validated Against XSD Schema.
 
The application allows to do:
•	Load existing project over the menu “File
•	Create a new project over the menu “File”
o	user should be able to
1-	select the location and name of the project file
2-	edit name
3-	edit project type
4-	add / edit / delete elements in value list
•	edit project (in main view or dialog, it doesn’t matter)
o	Edit name
o	edit project type
o	add / edit / delete elements in value list
(Note that buttons “edit” and “delete” are allowed only in case any value is selected. Multiple selections of values are not allowed.)
•	Save the project over the menu “File” (if data is schema compliant)
•	Close application (over menu file).
